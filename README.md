# pokedexproject

This is a project started by Louis/Louie Costanza, also known as LCCoolJ95

This program is designed for a user to learn about a Pokémon, an ability, a move, or an item, explaining more than what the game tells you.

It also includes a save feature where the user can save a Pokémon's page and come back to it whenever they please. With this, there's also a feature to remove that page.

Due to the fact that Github cannot upload files larger than 25 MB, the Pokédex Pro can be downloaded below:
